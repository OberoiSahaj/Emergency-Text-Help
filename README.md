# Emergency-Text-Help
This is an app created using python that helps us to send text message to our closed ones by clicking just one button. 
You can save the contacts of the people you want to message.
There is also a feature that converts what we speak into the text and then send the Emergency help text to our closed ones  
Another feature has been added in which along with your message, your location also gets sent in form of link!
*The  work is still in progress as we're trying to bring more features and finally bring it on Android. We don't know Android yet so it may take time*
